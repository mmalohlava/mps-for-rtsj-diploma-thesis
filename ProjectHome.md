The Real-time Specification of Java (RTSJ) is an intention to introduce Java as a language for developing real-time system.
However, the complexity of their development and a non-trivial programming model of RTSJ with its explicit memory management often lead to programming errors. To mitigate the development of RTSJ systems it would be beneficial to provide an internal domain-specific language extending Java language which would allow to develop the systems in more intuitive way.
One possible way of DSLs creation concerns the Meta-Programming System (MPS). It allows to develop new domain-specific languages and corresponding projectional editors enabling different views on code.

The goal of this thesis is to design and implement on the top of the MPS platform the DSL and corresponding code generator
which will enable development of RTSJ systems. Furthermore, the thesis should also provide evaluation of the MPS platform.

The final version of master thesis is in section Downloads.
